## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
##
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(viridis)

#read in data
df <- read.csv("journalism.csv")


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#random color generator

random_colors <- hue_pal()(10)

df %>%
  filter(rank == "Winner")%>%
  group_by(name)%>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  filter(total > 3) %>%
  
  
  ggplot(aes(x=total,y=name)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
theme_minimal() + labs(y = "Journalist", x = "Number of wins", title = "Who has the most James Beard Awards for Journalism?", subtitle = "Only including journalists with more than 3 awards" ) + scale_fill_manual(values = random_colors) 

  
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
